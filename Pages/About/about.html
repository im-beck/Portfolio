            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Hello, I'm Beck, and I'm all about 
                Software Development! Currently based in Central Newfoundland, 
                I'm building a solid foundation in full stack development through Keyin College
                and have really gotten to love front-end development and UI/UX in particular.</p>

                <p>My journey in tech started with a curiosity 
                in coding and video games. Over time, I've fine-tuned 
                my skills in programming and webpage design and tackled a 
                variety of projects.</p>
                
                <p>Collaboration is my strong suit, with a knack for 
                teamwork and building connections, I believe in the power of 
                diverse perspectives to enhance outcomes.</p>
                
                <p>I'm excited to contribue to the ever changing landscape
                of the tech sector and help create something that can improve people's lives. 
                Feel free to explore my portfolio, and let's 
                connect if you share similar interests or have potential 
                collaborations in mind!</p>
