            <br>
            <p>Hello, I'm Beck, and I'm all about 
                Software Development. Based in Newfoundland, 
                I'm building a solid foundation in full stack development
                and a genuine enjoyment of front-end development especially UI/UX.

                My journey in tech started with a curiosity 
                in coding and video games. Over time, I've fine-tuned 
                my skills in [Key Skills or Competencies] and tackled projects 
                like [Highlight a Key Project or Achievement] and 
                [Another Notable Project].
                
                Collaboration is my strong suit, with a knack for 
                [Communication or Collaboration Skills]. I believe in the power of 
                diverse perspectives to enhance outcomes.
                
                Looking forward, I'm excited about [Future Goals or Aspirations], 
                aiming to make a mark in [Your Industry]. 
                Feel free to explore my portfolio, and let's 
                connect if you share similar interests or have potential 
                collaborations in mind.</p>
