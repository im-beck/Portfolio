            <br>
            <p>Hello, I'm Beck, and I'm currently immersed in the world of 
                Software Development. Based in Central Newfoundland, 
                I'm diligently building a solid foundation in full-stack 
                development through Keyin College, with a growing interest 
                in front-end development and UI/UX.</p>

            <p>My journey into tech started with a curiosity about coding 
                and video games. Over time, I've refined my skills in 
                programming and webpage design, taking on various 
                projects along the way.</p>

            <p>Collaboration is my strong suit. With a natural knack for 
                teamwork and building connections, I believe in the value 
                of diverse perspectives to enhance outcomes.</p>

            <p>I look forward to contributing to the dynamic tech sector 
                and hope to create something meaningful that improves 
                people's lives. Explore my portfolio, and let's 
                connect if you share similar interests or have 
                potential collaborations in mind!</p>
